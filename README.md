# Ecommerce_Shipping_Classification_Dataset

**Project Overview:**

• 1: Data Exploration, Exploratory Data Analysis, Business Insight and Visualization

• 2: Data Cleansing and Feature Engineering

• 3: Modeling and Evaluation

**Overall Project:**

• Seek insight from the dataset with Exploratory Data Analysis

• Performed data cleansing, data processing, data engineering to prepare data before modeling

• Built a model to predict whether the shipping deliveries will be received late or on time by the customers

• Develop recommendations & benefit analysis based on insights and model prediction

**Background and Problem:**

An international e-commerce company that sells electronic products want to discover key insights from their customer database.

The dataset used contained 10999 observations with 12 variables.

**Modelling**

Split data into train and test

Trained model with 6 different algorithms such as Logistic Regression,K-Nearest Neighbors,Decision Tree,Support Vector Machine,Random Forest,Gradient Boosting.

Based on the model eveluation Gradient Boosting Algorithm gives higher accuracy comparatively to other models.

**Conclusion:**
* Most of the goods that delivered late is high importance product is shipped by ship.

* Customers rating is determined by qualtiy of the product.

**Business Recoomendations**

> Add estimated arrival time to assure the package arrived on time.

> Add more features to give more specific and accurate insights and perform operational audit based on the insights.
